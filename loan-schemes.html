                        require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include Our parent company and
                        any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that We control or that are
                        under common control with Us.

                        certain products, services or promotions.

                        With other users: when You share personal information or otherwise interact in the public areas
                        with other users, such information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed
                        outside.

                        With Your consent: We may disclose Your personal information for any other purpose with Your
                        consent.

                        Retention of Your Personal Data

                        The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set
                        out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to
                        comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply
                        with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

                        The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally
                        retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security
                        or to improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data
                        for longer time periods.

                        Transfer of Your Personal Data

                        Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and
                        in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this
                        information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state,
                        province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ
                        than those from Your jurisdiction.

                        Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents
                        Your agreement to that transfer.

                        The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated
                        securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will
                        take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including
                        the security of Your data and other personal information.

                        Delete Your Personal Data

                        You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We
                        have collected about You.

                        Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the
                        Service.

                        You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account, if
                        you have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal
                        information. You may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal
                        information that You have provided to Us.

                        Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal
                        obligation or lawful basis to do so.

                        Disclosure of Your Personal Data
                        Business Transactions
                        If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                        transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject
                        to a different Privacy Policy.

                        Law enforcement

                        Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if
                        required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or
                        a government agency).

                        Other legal requirements

                        The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is
                        necessary to:

                        Comply with a legal obligation

                        Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company

                        Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service

                        Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public

                        Protect against legal liability

                        Security of Your Personal Data

                        The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its
                        absolute security.

                        Children's Privacy

                        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                        identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and
                        You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We
                        become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without
                        verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.

                        If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                        requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use
                        that information.

                        Links to Other Websites

                        Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a
                        third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to
                        review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

                        We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                        practices of any third party sites or services.

                        We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting
                        the new Privacy Policy on this page.

                        becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

                        You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
                        Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
